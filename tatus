[33mc48bf8b[m Add Gemini AI direct PDF processing - New endpoint /api/process-pdf-gemini that sends PDFs directly to Gemini - Gemini analyzes PDF and generates quiz questions directly - Falls back to PDF.co API if Gemini fails - This bypasses text extraction issues and provides better quiz generation
[33m45108ed[m Fix PDF.co API integration - Implement proper two-step process: 1) Upload file to PDF.co storage, 2) Use returned URL for text extraction - This follows PDF.co's required workflow and should resolve the API integration issues
[33meedea2c[m Try different PDF.co API approach - Changed from file upload to direct base64 file parameter - Using different endpoint structure that might accept file data directly - This is a different approach to resolve the PDF.co API integration issues
[33me50845f[m Fix PDF.co API integration to use proper file upload method - Changed from base64 data URL to proper file upload to PDF.co - First uploads file to PDF.co, then converts uploaded file to text - This should resolve the 'Invalid input url' error from PDF.co API
